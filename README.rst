Our Contribution - Code Folding for IDLE
-------------------

This project adds a **code folding feature** to IDLE, Python’s built-in IDE.  
Code folding lets users collapse and expand sections of code such as functions, classes, loops, and conditionals. This improves readability and navigation, especially in large files.

Features
-------------------

- Collapse and expand code blocks with visual markers (e.g., +/-)  
- Keyboard shortcuts for folding/unfolding  
- Prevent editing inside folded blocks  
- Works with undo/redo without breaking history  
- Updates fold markers when files are opened or edited  

Why It Matters
-------------------

Most modern IDEs (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) support code folding, but IDLE does not.  
Adding this feature makes IDLE more usable for larger projects while keeping its beginner-friendly design.

`python.org`_.

Build Instructions
------------------

On Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, and Cygwin::

    ./configure
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

This will install Python as ``python3``.

You can pass many options to the configure script; run ``./configure --help``
to find out more.  On macOS case-insensitive file systems and on Cygwin,
the executable is called ``python.exe``; elsewhere it's just ``python``.

Building a complete Python installation requires the use of various
additional third-party libraries, depending on your build platform and
configure options.  Not all standard library modules are buildable or
usable on all platforms.  Refer to the
`Install dependencies <https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building.html#build-dependencies>`_
section of the `Developer Guide`_ for current detailed information on
dependencies for various Linux distributions and macOS.

On macOS, there are additional configure and build options related
to macOS framework and universal builds.  Refer to `Mac/README.rst
<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Mac/README.rst>`_.

On Windows, see `PCbuild/readme.txt
<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/PCbuild/readme.txt>`_.

To build Windows installer, see `Tools/msi/README.txt
<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/msi/README.txt>`_.
